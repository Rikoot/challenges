#### Setup Instructions
Download the `src` folder. It contains a split and compressed .ova file. Use the following command to extract it `cat ./src/*.tgz_* | tar xz`, when the `src` folder is in your current directory. In VMware Workstation, import the VM. Give it a name, then power it on. The IP address will appear in the Console view under `Primary IP address`.
